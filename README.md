Flickr API

This project is part of The Odin Project(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/apis#project-2-using-a-third-party-api)

In this project I learned to work with gems, and third party APIs.

The challenging part for me was figuring out how to parse through all the docs for both (outdated)gems and the API.
